# Job-Analysis

This is a website that lets users insert their resume as a pdf, input relevant preferences(location/distance, entry level, etc..), and then get a list of the most relevant job postings on Linkedin from a pre-collected dataset. This is powered through the SentenceTransformers LLM, which enables powerful text similarity calculations. Pymupdf is also used to extract text from the provided PDFs.
